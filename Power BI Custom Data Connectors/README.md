# Power BI Custom Data Connectors #

This session introduces Power BI and the M language at a high-level to give context to creating a Custom Data Connector for Power BI. This is an evolving presentation and the samples will continue to change as I refine the 60 and 75 minute formats of the talk.

The PDF of the slide deck has links to the relevant documentation from Microsoft and helpful blogs from others in the Power BI space.
