# Conference Talks and Demos

The folders in this repo contain PDFs of presentations and any supporting files that I (hopefully) pointed out during the talk or demonstration. All of these are living folders and will be updated as I give the talks again or learn something new that might be helpful to others on the subject. 

Please feel free to connect with me on Twitter (@ryanbooz) to provide any feedback.
