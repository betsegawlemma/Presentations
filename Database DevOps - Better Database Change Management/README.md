## Database DevOps: Better Database Change Management

The slides and demo for this talk currently focus on PostgreSQL as the
primary database. The public GitHub repository, which includes the 
GitHub Actions workflows is linked below and will, to the best of my
ability, be updated as time goes and the presentation may change.

The repository currently uses Flyway, including features in the Teams
and Enterprise version, to create a full end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that
includes SQL linting, drift detection, and more.
