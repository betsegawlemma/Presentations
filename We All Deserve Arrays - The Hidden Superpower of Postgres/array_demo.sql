-- remember that PostgreSQL is one-based, not zero

/*

/*
 * Searching arrays

-- searching for any value in the array that matches
SELECT * FROM film WHERE 'suspense' = any(film_type);
-- && is known as the "overlap" operator
SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_type && '{suspense}';

-- and finally there is 'contains'. The array on the 
-- side of the @ symbol is used as the template and 
-- Postgres "probes" with the other side to see if 
-- to see if it's fully contained in the template
SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_type @> '{suspense}';

-- this returns nothing because 'film_type' has more
-- values that are not contained in the template
SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_type <@ '{suspense}';

-- but this does work, regardless of the order
SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_type <@ '{suspense,documentary,action}';

/*
 * Indexing
 */
-- Arrays can be indexed with GIN which makes it possible
-- to efficiently search for values within the array
CREATE INDEX idx_film_type ON film USING GIN (film_type);

-- Because this table is so small (2 rows), we have to 
-- suggest to Postgres NOT to just scann all the rows

/*
 * Pattern matching
 */
-- essentially a "split to array"
SELECT string_to_array(title,' ') FROM film;
-- But it returns the string in whole if no match is found
SELECT string_to_array(title,':') FROM film;
-- I also can't refer to the elements directly
SELECT string_to_array(title,':')[1] FROM film;

-- Instead it needs to be the result of a set (in the FROM)
-- Again notice that the first one returns the entire string
SELECT p[1] FROM film 
	CROSS JOIN LATERAL string_to_array(title,':') AS p;

-- you can replace CROSS JOIN LATERAL with a comma shorthand
SELECT p[1] FROM film, string_to_array(title,':') AS p;


-- more power than 'string_to_array' with regex capabilities
SELECT regexp_split_to_array(title,'\s+') FROM film; 

-- more advanced splitting and pattern matching using regexp
-- with capturing groups 
SELECT regexp_match(title,'(.*):') FROM film;

-- only return the element from the title where
-- it started with text and contained a colon
SELECT p FROM film, regexp_match(title,'(.*):') AS p WHERE p IS NOT null;

-- and finally, we can use WITH ORDINALITY with the 
-- output of any SRF
SELECT title, ft.* FROM film, 
	unnest(film_type) WITH ORDINALITY AS ft(film_type,array_order);

-- first split the word and then unnest that
-- array for word order in this example
SELECT ft.* FROM film, 
	regexp_split_to_array(title,' ') WITH ORDINALITY ft(word,o);

SELECT ft.* FROM film, 
	unnest(regexp_split_to_array(title,' ')) WITH ORDINALITY ft(word,o);
