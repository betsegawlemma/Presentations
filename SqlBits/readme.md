# SQLBits Stand-alone Dashboard

This is a quick stand-alone recreation of a dashboard that Terry McCann ([@SQLShark](https://twitter.com/sqlshark)) put together on [Github](https://github.com/SQLShark/SQLBitsDashboard) showing the breakdown of sessions by speaker, track and topic for SQLBits 2019. I didn't want to setup the Python web scrapping and Power BI already has the capability to do the same. 

Unfortunately any attempt to modify the source data meant that I lost his calculated measures. For speed, I simply created measures in an attempt to recreate his results.
